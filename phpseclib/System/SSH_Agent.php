/**
 * Pure-PHP ssh-agent client wrapper
 *
 * PHP versions 4 and 5
 *
 * Originally System_SSH_Agent was accessed as System/SSH_Agent.php instead of
 * System/SSH/Agent.php. The problem with this is that PSR0 compatible autoloaders
 * don't support that kind of directory layout hence the package being moved and
 * this "alias" being created to maintain backwards compatibility.
